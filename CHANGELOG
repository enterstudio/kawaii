What's new in Kawaii?

November 7, 2008:
- Fixed: bug that prevented the 'Save Snippet' button from appearing on the initial tab
- Added ability to store snippets locally in an ActiveRecord model (KawaiiSnippet)

August 11, 2008:

- Client-side pagination is in place for the datatable, so you can return many results.
- Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl-Enter to execute a query
- Strings are formatted better. 
- Fixed: mysql defined prematurely (thanks http://github.com/oculardisaster)

August 5, 2008:

- Fixed bug with proxy queries not being rendered correctly
   e.g: User.find_by_name('robin').addresses didn't work before
- Added support for rendering Arrays of Hashes
- Added support for typing in SELECT SQL queries directly in the console and getting nice formatting!
   e.g: select * from users where name = 'robin'
   
   Kawaii does this by checking if the first thing you type in is 'select' with a 'from' later on.
   I don't think this should cause any collisions with actual ruby code, but let me know!

July 29, 2008:

- Moved around all sorts of files so that you can update Kawaii easier in the future. See README for upgrading instructions.
- Configuration is now in a YAML file
- Note about Prototype.js being required in the README
- If your YAML doesn't have the snippets enabled option, it doesn't barf if you don't have the aws-s3 gem installed.
- Added display support for Hash
- Added empty array fix (thanks http://github.com/wwood)
